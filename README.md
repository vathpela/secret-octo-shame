=================

There are a couple of things here:
* asmtest - assemble crap at runtime.  Wildly unfinished.
* scncopy - kindof like objcopy in a way, but no bfd
* dltest - dynamically build a DSO and add it to the dl namespace
* libso.so - beginnings of a sortof libelf-like library for DSOs specifically
* dso.so - just a little sample DSO for other tools to use
